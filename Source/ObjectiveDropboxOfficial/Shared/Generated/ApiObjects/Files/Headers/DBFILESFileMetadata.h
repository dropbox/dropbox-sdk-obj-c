#pragma mark - Instance fields

/// A unique identifier for the file.

/// For files, this is the modification time set by the desktop client when the
/// file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox

/// determine if a file has changed or not.

#pragma mark - Constructors

///
/// Full constructor for the struct (exposes all instance variables).
///
/// @param name The last component of the path (including extension). This never
/// contains a slash.
/// @param id_ A unique identifier for the file.
/// @param clientModified For files, this is the modification time set by the
/// desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not
/// verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up),
/// this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for
/// example, to determine if a file has changed or not.
/// @param serverModified The last time the file was modified on Dropbox.
/// @param rev A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This
/// field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect
/// changes and avoid conflicts.
/// @param size The file size in bytes.
/// @param pathLower The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always
/// starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not
/// mounted.
/// @param pathDisplay The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In
/// rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem,
/// but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at
/// least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only
/// the casing of paths won't be returned by `listFolderContinue`. This field
/// will be null if the file or folder is not mounted.
/// @param parentSharedFolderId Deprecated. Please use `parentSharedFolderId` in
/// `DBFILESFileSharingInfo` or `parentSharedFolderId` in
/// `DBFILESFolderSharingInfo` instead.
/// @param mediaInfo Additional information if the file is a photo or video.
/// @param sharingInfo Set if this file is contained in a shared folder.
/// @param propertyGroups Additional information if the file has custom
/// properties with the property template specified.
/// @param hasExplicitSharedMembers This flag will only be present if
/// include_has_explicit_shared_members  is true in `listFolder` or
/// `getMetadata`. If this  flag is present, it will be true if this file has
/// any explicit shared  members. This is different from sharing_info in that
/// this could be true  in the case where a file has explicit members but is not
/// contained within  a shared folder.
