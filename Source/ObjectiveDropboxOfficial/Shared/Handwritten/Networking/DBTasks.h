///
/// Base class for network task wrappers.
///
/// After a network request is made via `DBTransportClient`, a subclass of `DBTask` is returned, from which response and
/// progress handlers can be installed, and the network response paused or cancelled.
///
/// Handlers are executed on the thread specified by the `DBDelegate` instance with which the `DBTask` instance is
/// initialied (more specifically, the delegate queue that the `DBDelegate` uses to execute handler code). By default,
/// this is the main thread, which makes updating UI elements in response handlers convenient.
///
/// While response handlers are not optional, they do not necessarily need to have been installed by the time the SDK
/// has received its server response. If this is the case, completion data will be saved, and the handler will be
/// executed with the completion data upon its installation. Downloaded content will be moved from a temporary location
/// to the final destination when the response handler code is executed.
